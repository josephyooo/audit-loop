# Audit & Review Loop

Audit the repo, file issues, trigger the address agent to fix them, review each PR, and do a final sweep.

## Prerequisites

- Current directory is a git repo
- tmux sessions: `audit` (this session) and `address` (the address agent)
- `gh` CLI authenticated with repo access

## Sending Triggers — CRITICAL RULES

Every `tmux send-keys` that sends a trigger phrase to the other agent **MUST** follow all three rules below. Violating any one of them breaks the loop silently.

1. **The quoted string MUST end with a trailing space.** Example: `"ADDRESS: revise PR #4 "` — note the space before the closing quote. This is required because Copilot CLI (and some other agents) autocomplete on `#<number>`; without the trailing space, pressing Enter selects an autocomplete suggestion instead of submitting your literal text. Do NOT strip or "clean up" this trailing space — it is load-bearing.
2. **Enter MUST be sent in a separate bash call.** Not chained with `&&` or `;`. Two distinct bash tool invocations.
3. **Do not substitute `C-m` for `Enter`** — they behave differently in some agent terminals.

Correct pattern (two separate bash calls):
```bash
tmux send-keys -t address "ADDRESS: revise PR #4 "
```
```bash
tmux send-keys -t address Enter
```

Every send-keys snippet below follows this pattern. Preserve it exactly.

## Receive Protocol

**On any input**, check whether it matches a known trigger phrase (`AUDIT: review PR #N` or `AUDIT: complete`). If it does, handle it per the protocol below.

**On session start or after any interruption**, check `.audit-loop/state.json`. If a cycle is in progress and `phase` is `reviewing`, resume by re-reading the current PR and reviewing it. If `phase` is `audit-looping`, the audit was interrupted — restart from Step 1.

**Important:** `needs-human` on one PR does NOT halt the cycle. The agent proceeds to the next batch. Only the capped PR is deferred.

## State File

All loop state lives in `.audit-loop/state.json` (in the repo root). This file is the source of truth for cycle progress, batch counts, and revision rounds.

After every action, update `last_trigger_time` to the current ISO 8601 timestamp.

### Timeout Check

On receiving any trigger, read `last_trigger_time` from state.json. If more than 30 minutes have elapsed:

```bash
# Label all open audit PRs as needs-human
for pr in $(gh pr list --label audit-loop --state open --json number -q '.[].number'); do
  gh pr edit "$pr" --add-label "needs-human"
done
```

Print: "WARNING: {elapsed} since last activity. Other agent may be stalled. Labeled open PRs `needs-human` and stopping."

Set `phase` to `complete` in state.json and stop.

## Protocol

### Step 1: Audit the repo

Analyze the entire codebase for substantive issues across these categories:
- **security** — injection, auth flaws, secrets, insecure defaults
- **correctness** — logic errors, off-by-ones, race conditions, null handling
- **performance** — unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries, missing indexes
- **maintainability** — dead code, unclear control flow, missing error handling
- **dependency** — deprecated/vulnerable packages, version issues

Skip trivial style nits unless they mask bugs.

### Step 2: Initialize state

Create the `.audit-loop/` directory and add it to `.gitignore`:

```bash
mkdir -p .audit-loop
grep -qxF '.audit-loop/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.audit-loop/' >> .gitignore
```

Write initial state:

```bash
cat > .audit-loop/state.json << 'STATEEOF'
{
  "cycle_id": "TIMESTAMP",
  "phase": "audit-looping",
  "current_pr": null,
  "current_batch": 0,
  "revision_round": 0,
  "batches_created": 0,
  "last_trigger": "audit-start",
  "last_trigger_time": "ISO8601_NOW"
}
STATEEOF
```

Replace `TIMESTAMP` and `ISO8601_NOW` with actual values.

### Step 3: File GitHub issues

Ensure labels exist (run once):

```bash
for label in audit-loop severity:critical severity:high severity:medium severity:low \
  cat:security cat:correctness cat:performance cat:maintainability cat:dependency \
  needs-human tests-failing in-progress fix-submitted fix-verified; do
  gh label create "$label" --force 2>/dev/null
done
```

**Before filing each issue, check for duplicates** among previously closed `audit-loop` issues:

```bash
gh issue list --label audit-loop --state closed --json number,title,body,labels --limit 200
```

For each finding, search the closed issues for matches on the same file path and category. If a match is found:
- **Reopen the original issue** instead of filing a new one:
  ```bash
  gh issue reopen <number>
  gh issue comment <number> --body "Recurrence detected. This issue was previously fixed but has reappeared. Escalating severity — a deeper/systemic fix is needed."
  ```
- **Escalate severity** by one level (low→medium, medium→high, high→critical):
  ```bash
  gh issue edit <number> --remove-label "severity:<old>" --add-label "severity:<new>"
  ```
- Remove any stale state labels (`fix-submitted`, `fix-verified`) from the reopened issue.

If no duplicate is found, create a new issue:

```bash
gh issue create --title "<concise title>" \
  --body "<file path, line range, what's wrong, why it matters, suggested fix>" \
  --label "audit-loop" --label "severity:<level>" --label "cat:<category>"
```

Include enough detail that a fixer can work without re-auditing. Order by severity (critical first).

**Pattern detection:** After filing all issues, review them as a group. If 3+ issues share a root cause (e.g., multiple unsanitized inputs, repeated missing null checks in the same subsystem), add a comment to one of them noting the pattern and suggesting a systemic fix rather than N individual patches.

### Step 4: Trigger address agent

Update state.json: set `phase` to `address-fixing`, update `last_trigger_time`.

```bash
tmux send-keys -t address "/address ADDRESS: begin "
```
Then in a **separate** bash call (preserve the trailing space above; do NOT chain with && or ;):
```bash
tmux send-keys -t address Enter
```

Print: "Triggered address agent. Waiting for review request..."

Then wait for the address agent to send a message to this session.

### Step 5: Handle incoming triggers

When a message arrives, first run the timeout check (see above). Then act based on its prefix:

#### On "AUDIT: review PR #N"

Update state.json: set `phase` to `reviewing`, `current_pr` to N, update `last_trigger_time`.

1. **Check for clarification requests** from the address agent before reviewing:
   ```bash
   gh pr view N --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | startswith("Clarification needed:")) | .body'
   ```
   If a clarification comment exists without a follow-up response, answer it directly based on your original review intent:
   ```bash
   gh pr comment N --body "<answer the clarification>"
   ```
   Then, **in this order** (the address agent reads state.json immediately on trigger):
   1. Set `awaiting_clarification` to `false` in state.json
   2. Send `ADDRESS: revise PR #N` via tmux

   Do not proceed with the diff review — the address agent will revise first.

2. Read the PR:
   ```bash
   gh pr view N
   gh pr diff N
   ```

3. For each issue the PR claims to address, verify the fix is correct and complete.

4. Check for regressions or new issues introduced by the changes.

5. **Check for `tests-failing` label.** If the PR has this label, do NOT approve — request changes explaining the test failure must be resolved first.

6. **Review principle:** If the fix correctly addresses the issue and introduces no regressions, APPROVE — even if you would have implemented it differently. Request changes only when:
   - The fix is logically incorrect
   - The fix is incomplete (the issue can still be reproduced)
   - The fix introduces a regression

   Do NOT request changes for: variable naming, code style, comment wording, formatting, or implementation approach differences where both approaches are correct. Those are the linter's job.

7. Decision:

   **If the fixes are correct and tests pass — approve with a detailed comment** explaining what you verified. Don't just say "Fixes verified." — describe what you checked:
   ```bash
   gh pr review N --approve --body "## Verification

   - Issue #X: <what you verified — e.g., confirmed parameterized query prevents injection>
   - Issue #Y: <what you verified>
   - Checked for regressions: <what you tested>
   - Docs: <note if docs were updated or didn't need updating>"
   ```

   Also verify that any documentation affected by the changes (README, inline comments, config examples) was updated. If docs are stale, request changes for the doc update — not for the fix itself.

   Mark addressed issues as verified:
   ```bash
   for issue in $(gh pr view N --json body -q '.body' | grep -oiE 'closes?\s+#[0-9]+' | grep -oE '[0-9]+'); do
     gh issue edit "$issue" --add-label "fix-verified"
   done
   ```

   Update state.json: set `phase` to `address-fixing`, `revision_round` to 0, update `last_trigger_time`.
   ```bash
   tmux send-keys -t address "ADDRESS: continue "
```
Then in a **separate** bash call (preserve the trailing space above; do NOT chain with && or ;):
```bash
tmux send-keys -t address Enter
   ```

   **If revisions are needed — request changes:**

   Read `revision_round` from state.json. Do NOT increment it — the address agent owns that counter and increments on push.

   **Convergence check (after 2nd revision, before requesting the 3rd):** If `revision_round` >= 2, check for convergence before requesting another round. Read `revision_history` from state.json and get the previous revision's commit SHA. Compare:
   ```bash
   base=$(gh pr view N --json commits --jq '.commits[0].oid')
   prev_commit=<from revision_history[-1].commit>
   curr_diff=$(git diff $prev_commit..HEAD | wc -l)
   prev_diff=$(git diff $base..$prev_commit | wc -l)
   ```
   If `curr_diff` < 30% of `prev_diff`, the revisions are cancelling each other out. Do NOT request another revision:
   ```bash
   gh pr review N --comment --body "Revisions are not converging — same lines toggling across revisions. Escalating to human review."
   gh pr edit N --add-label "needs-human"
   ```
   Update state.json: set `phase` to `address-fixing`, `revision_round` to 0, update `last_trigger_time`.
   ```bash
   tmux send-keys -t address "ADDRESS: continue "
```
Then in a **separate** bash call (preserve the trailing space above; do NOT chain with && or ;):
```bash
tmux send-keys -t address Enter
   ```

   If `revision_round` >= 3 (cap reached):
   ```bash
   gh pr review N --comment --body "3 revision rounds reached. Deferring remaining concerns to human review."
   gh pr edit N --add-label "needs-human"
   ```
   Update state.json: set `phase` to `address-fixing`, `revision_round` to 0, update `last_trigger_time`.
   ```bash
   tmux send-keys -t address "ADDRESS: continue "
```
Then in a **separate** bash call (preserve the trailing space above; do NOT chain with && or ;):
```bash
tmux send-keys -t address Enter
   ```

   Otherwise, use the structured review template — no prose reviews:
   ```bash
   gh pr review N --request-changes --body "$(cat <<'REVIEWEOF'
   ## Changes Requested

   ### [WRONG|INCOMPLETE|REGRESSION] Issue #<num>: <one-line summary>
   **File**: `path/to/file:line_range`
   **Current behavior**: <what the code does now>
   **Required behavior**: <what it must do>
   **Specific change**: <what line/function/pattern needs to change>
   REVIEWEOF
   )"
   ```

   The classifier tells the address agent *how* to fix:
   - `WRONG` — logic error, revert and re-approach
   - `INCOMPLETE` — fix is correct but doesn't cover all cases
   - `REGRESSION` — fix breaks something that was working

   Update state.json: set `phase` to `address-fixing`, update `last_trigger_time`.
   ```bash
   tmux send-keys -t address "ADDRESS: revise PR #N "
```
Then in a **separate** bash call (preserve the trailing space above; do NOT chain with && or ;):
```bash
tmux send-keys -t address Enter
   ```

#### On "AUDIT: complete"

Update state.json: set `phase` to `complete`, update `last_trigger_time`.

Proceed to Step 6.

### Step 6: Final sweep

1. List remaining open issues:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --label audit-loop --state open
   ```

2. Summarize:
   ```
   ## Audit Complete

   Issues filed: <N>
   PRs created: <N>
   Issues resolved: <N>
   Issues remaining: <N>
   Escalated to human: <N> (labeled needs-human)
   ```

## Error handling

- If `tmux send-keys -t address` fails: stop and tell the user to start the address agent in a tmux session named `address`.
- If `gh` commands fail: retry once, then print the error and stop.
- If the address agent never responds: print "Waiting for address agent. If it has stopped, restart it in the `address` tmux session and type `ADDRESS: begin` to resume."
